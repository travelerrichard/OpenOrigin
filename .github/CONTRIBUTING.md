# Contributing

## Branch model
- Create feature branches from `main`: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`
- Open Pull Requests to `main` (protected)
- CI must be green, comments resolved, squash-merge

## Commit style
- Conventional commits (recommended): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.

## Reviews
- CODEOWNERS auto-requests reviewers based on paths
- One approval required (default). Mods may raise to two later.

## CI
- Keep job names stable (`ci`, `build_and_test`) so branch protections can require them.
